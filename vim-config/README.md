Key things to remember: 
+ We had made a vimrc to create our theme for the dotfiles of jellybean
+ .gitconfig was also used in this assignment to push our repository over to github.
+ To navigate some key shortcuts I used are:
+   i  iinsert mode
+   x delete current line you are on 
+   u undo
+   :w saves the file
+   :q is for quitting
+   :q! quitting (override)
+   I also used arrows to navigate around
