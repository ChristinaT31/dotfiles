Task 4 overall:
+TASK 1 EDITS:
+ For task 1 the issue I will be fixing is: renaming the file from 'setup_vim.sh!' to 'setup_vimfinal.sh'
+ I did this by cd into the dotfiles folder where the initail file is located and entered the 'mv setup_vim.sh\! setup_vimfinal.sh' command to change the name.
+ Confirming the change has been made when I hit ls to see all the file names.

+ Located in the README.md in the vim-config file I have entered some shortcuts that I used a lot initially.
