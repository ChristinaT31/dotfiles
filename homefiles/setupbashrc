Below is the script that will backup and link the dotfiles repository and the output of it working: 
#!/bin/bash
# Backup existing .bashrc if it exists
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.backup
    echo "Backup of existing .bashrc created as .bashrc.backup"
fi

# Create symbolic link
ln -s ~/dotfiles/homefiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
echo "Symbolic link created for .bashrc."

# Prompt user to reload environment
echo "Run 'source ~/.bashrc' to apply changes."
